## How to install build and test application locally
To build, please execute this command inside the anchor_project folder
```sh
    anchor build
```
To test, please execute this command inside the anchor_project folder
```sh
    anchor test
```
Don't forget to set solana network to localhost
```sh
    solana config set -u localhost
```

Then, you can launch the frontend application (NextJS) with (in frontend folder)
```sh
    yarn dev
```
To deploy the application, you can execute this
```sh
    yarn run vercel build
    yarn run vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

The application will be accessible at localhost:3000

>[!CAUTION]
>The application works exclusively with Phantom actually, but in the futur, I will add other wallet.
